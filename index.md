More About CyberSEED 2019
The theme for the Synchrony’s Cybersecurity Awareness Month this year is “Own. Secure. Update.” Synchrony, UConn and the backers of the associated National Cybersecurity Awareness initiative have decided upon a strategic focus that emphasizes personal responsibility over specific technologies. Part of the reason: many
small businesses have little or no investment in cybersecurity. According to a Juniper Research 2018, the typical small business invests less than $500/year in cybersecurity. This is true despite an 11% increase in security breaches over the past year, and a five year increase of 67%.

Indeed, executives and owners in small to medium size businesses (SMB’s) need to become more involved. Increased cybersecurity investment is an important step, but it won’t be enough. In an increasingly automated, software-driven, risk-rich landscape,
cybersecurity awareness must be extended to home computer users and employees in SMB’s in order to move the safety needle.

“Small and medium sized businesses are increasingly on the front line of this battle,” Synchrony’s CISO George Smirnoff said recently. “Whether they are aware, or just underfunded in the cybersecurity realm is unclear, but we need to do what we can to help them. Not doing so creates widespread risks for all – even the best-defended
among us.”


**DevOps vs. the "Security People"**
Date/Time: Friday, 6/21/19 1-3pm

Location: [Travelers CRM-1, 45 Central Row, Hartford,
CT 06103](https://goo.gl/maps/bb9Xz397CmeLcfBf7)

Agenda:

1pm: "DevOps vs “Security People"

In 2019, surveys are saying that 90% of Fortune 500 plan on using
containers and things like Kubernetes, yet there’s still a divide
between what “security people” see that containers provide and what
DevOps teams see. Kubernetes has become the defacto standard for
production container deployments and there are 98 different options (as
of February 2019) for hosted Kubernetes clouds. In many cases a
Kubernetes threat model becomes compromised either by accident or by
alibi and even if you wanted to harden your environment, there’s little
guidance. Is there truly such a thing as a Kubernetes best practice? How
can Kubernetes handle multiple tenants in a cluster? Do hosted
Kubernetes services provide enough security for your work load? This
talk will explore Kubernetes’ known attack vectors, defenses, and see
how we can bridge the silos between security engineers and developers to
help in the future.

2pm: panel / chapter meeting TBD

3pm: networking

Speaker: Mark Manning is a Principal Security Consultant with NCC Group
and a lead in their Container Practice. He focuses on container
technologies, Linux kernel security, and application security, in
general. He has performed penetration tests to breakout from containers,
delivered architecture reviews of devops environments, and worked with
developers on various container and orchestration technologies such as
Docker, Kubernetes, Mesos/Marathon, as well as Rancher. Mark currently
organizes Rochester 2600 has also organized BSidesROC from 2010 through
2018.

**UNH CyberAgent Academy CTF planning**
Date/Time: 6/21/19

This is a planning session for the CTF that OWASP CT members are helping to build out for UNH's CyberAgent Academy coming up on July 22 - July 27. Currently, we are looking at two CTF platforms, FacebookCTF and CTFd, to use for the summer camp.

Anyone that is willing to assist with play-testing, creating CTF challenges, operating the CTF is welcome to attend.

About:
The high school GenCyber Agent Academy (incoming 9th-12th grade) at the University of New Haven, hosted by the Tagliatela College of Engineering, is a unique, rigorous, student-centric summer camp with an enriching hands-on experiential learning environment. It is the first GenCyber camp in Connecticut and is open to 20 male and 20 female applicants. Cyber Agents accepted to this academy will enjoy a Cyber Career Catapult session where they will learn about educational and career opportunities in cybersecurity.

The camp offers the following courses (a) Python (b) Cyber Forensics (c) Hacking Concepts (d) IoT & Mobile and (e) Network Defense. Cyber Agents will also have unique experiences where they would tour the UNH Information Technology (IT) offices and server rooms, participate in a cyber Scavenger Hunt and compete in teams in a Cyber Challenge. The camp is a comprehensive one week, learner-centered, hands-on, intensive program designed not only to teach students about cybersecurity, but to also have a long term effect on their career goals and aspirations.

Wireless Security Workshop

**Presentation:** [**<File:OWASP> Wireless Security
101.pdf**](:File:OWASP_Wireless_Security_101.pdf "wikilink")

This session will take a departure from some of our recent OWASP
sessions. The hosts at MakeHartford have generously offered their
classroom space for this security lab session/workshop coming out of the
OWASP pen-testing initiative group. Jon Williams will be presenting and
demonstrating some fundamental wireless security concepts. Depending on
time and if we get access to some COTS routers, we may also try to do
some hands-on wireless security testing. Plan on bringing your laptop
and spare wireless router if you can. This session is oriented toward
folks looking to learn about wireless security and getting introduced to
wireless security concepts for the first time.

Note: Due to the classroom size, we're limiting this to the first 20
participants.

Agenda:

  - Overview: Wireless security concepts
  - Remote access, Local network - encrypted and unencrypted
  - Wireless attacks:
  - Rogue access point, MiTM, Session Hijacking, Radio monitoring,
    Session theft
  - Review: Risks to remote workers
  - Game time: defensive techniques
  - Demonstration: Wireless Man-in-the-Middle and Rogue AP

About Jon Williams:

Jon Williams hails from Cheshire, CT, where he lives with his wife and
daughter and works from home as Security Administrator for IGG Software.
A taste for adventure has carried him far, from the islands of the
Bahamas where he worked towards building an eco-hostel, to the deserts
of Egypt where he taught children at environmental leadership camps, to
the high seas where he circumscribed the globe in a steamship. His
passion for technology led him into the security field, where he now
spends an unhealthy proportion of his time trying to break computer
systems so that others might improve them. He recently attained a CISSP
certification and actively contributes to projects at OWASP Hartford

**Agenda: Wednesday, Apr 26th 2017**
6:30PM - 9PM
OWASP @ MakeHartford
**Presentation:** [**<File:OWASP> Hartford pen-test lab intiative
20170322.pdf**](:File:OWASP_Hartford_pen-test_lab_intiative_20170322.pdf "wikilink")

We've got a new team working on putting together a security / pen
testing lab and security learning environment here in CT.  The goal is
to have a place where we can create and share security and pen testing
tips and tricks with our members, as well as using the lab as a means to
bolster our outreach efforts to the colleges in the area.

We're going to use this initial session to explore the MakeHartford
space and start building up that lab. If you're interested, we would
love to see you at this session. Otherwise, shoot me an email and i'll
keep you posted on working group meetings moving forward.
